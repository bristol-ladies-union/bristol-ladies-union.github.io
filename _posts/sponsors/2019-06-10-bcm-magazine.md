Bristol Community Magazines Limted, Publisher of the Bristol Nine and Bristol Eight magazines. Both are free, full-colour, A5 glossy magazines that contain a mixture of interesting adverts and readable stuff, both with a decidedly local slant. Their purpose, is two fold – a professional and very affordable means for businesses to promote their services and products to the people of this part of north Bristol, and an engaging and informal little read for those people who receive the magazine through their letterbox free each month.

The businesses that feature are almost entirely based in and around the BS8 and BS9 area, and most of them are small concerns who find the cost of advertising in them attractive compared to bigger publications whose focus is less on community and more on lifestyle.
​
Finally, both magazines contain a large free listings section, to help those people who run clubs, put on shows and concerts, and organise charity events, to spread the word about the great things they are up to here in the community.
