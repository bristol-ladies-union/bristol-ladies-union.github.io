## Report

It was a shaky start for the U11 team, losing the first game 1-0 but once the team settled into their rhythm there was no looking back.
Scoring 15 goals and conceding only 2, BLU U11 stormed their way to a convincing 3-0 win in the tournament final against Longwell Green.

Outstanding performances throughout the team but special mentions for a hatrick of hatricks from Suki, a hatrick from Isobelle and some heroic goal keeping from Tia.
