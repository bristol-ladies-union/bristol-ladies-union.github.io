## Report

### A brilliant performance  

Spring sun and blue skies greeted the players and fans for an early kick off at Canford Park.  Recent winning form of the BLUs (or rather the nice weather) meant a big crowd crammed into the Canford Lane terrace ready to cheer their teams on. Inspiring words from the coaches preceded a quick start to the game from the girls. Emilie and Betsy were majestic at the back. Betsy driving forward and Emilie reading the game superbly meant the team never looked like conceding. Kate was untroubled in goal but did what she needed to do well â€“ calm in possession and nice distribution.  The midfield trio of Katherine, Iris and Jess worked well together.  Katherine working hard up and down the left, delivering powerful throw-ins and Iris breaking up play in the middle and feeding Jess and Evie. There was lots of early BLUs pressure but the Portishead team stood firm until Betsy collected the ball deep, skilled past four players and smashed one into the roof of the net. The BLUs were off.  Jess threatened and finally got her reward with the well taken second after a great pass from Betsy. Evie working tirelessly and giving the Portishead centre back a merry time, went close from a corner and Mairead (always in the right place) almost got the third after a lovely sweeping BLUs passing attack.

No complacency from the BLUs as they continued in the same vein kicking towards the Abbey Road end for the second half. A switch in goal with Ellie taking the gloves and Lily and Katherine at the back continued the fantastic defensive work. Both comfortable receiving the ball from Ellie and playing the second pass well and starting most BLU attacks.  Their defensive work was faultless.  Ellie made some great saves coming off her line to keep the Portishead attacks at bay and had a great half in goal.  Iris was everywhere, almost scoring and bravely taking a blast to the face needing quick treatment from the BLUs medical team. Betsy, Evie and Mairead linking well, a nice one-two and Betsy firing home again. Kate, unleashed into the outfield held the ball up well in the forward position and slotted home nicely from another lovely corner from Evie. There was some late Portishead pressure but Ellie stood firm meaning another clean sheet for the BLUs as they march up the table towards a Champions League place.
