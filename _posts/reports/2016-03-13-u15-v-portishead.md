> U15 Portishead 0 - 3 BLU FC

> Players of Match: Charity and Chloe

With a few girls under the weather, both keepers not available and on a very heavy pitch with the grass up to your ankles it was always going to be a testing game.

But the girls played some nice football considering, eventually overcoming the offside flag going up every time we attacked.

Mayca broke the deadlock with a solo run through Portishead defence to round the keeper to put it into a empty net, there weren't many chances but trying to run with the football was impossible and even a big boot up the field was hard to do as players was losing their footing.

Half-time score: 1-0

Ellie came on at the start of the second half despite not feeling too good (dreaded lurgy... she's off school too now -- ed.):Â she'd been taking photos while sat on the floor in the first half, hence we've got photos this week.

Olivia picked the ball up on the wing and went into the opponent's box, was just going to shoot but was taken out: enough for the ref to award a penalty - and Charity blasted it home.

Portishead got into the game but never had a shot on target which was good for Madison who was deputising in goal.

Some good work between Anja and Sophie allowed Hannah to collect the ball and fire the ball into the roof of the net from the edge of the box.

Ellie had played really well (despite the lurgy) but only lasted 20 mins in the end, but really good of her to try, and her being on the pitch made a difference as it allowed other players to push up the pitch more and it was during that period that two of the goals were scored.

Charity, Chloe, Emily and Sophie all had a very good game in defence and Anja, Anna and Caitlin really ran the midfield. Mayca and Hannah always looked dangerous on the break; Abigail came on each half and played her part.
