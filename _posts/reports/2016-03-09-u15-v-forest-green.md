## Report

> Final score 6 - 2 to Bristol Ladies Union

> Players of the match Charity , Mayca, and the very hard working Anya, all had outstanding performances along with the rest of the team.

Having not played for the whole of February (matches being rained off plus being the odd team out last week so no match), the girls put up a great performance against a strong Forest Green Rovers side - with three of our girls ill the rest of team did really well.

From the start we were on the attack with Hannah going very close.

Within 5 minutes Forest Green broke away to score a opportunist goal.

Back on the attack playing some lovely football we open our scoring with two well taken goals through Mayca. With Madison, Sophie, and Olivia Burton being a constant threat down the wings, goals were bound to come.

Half time score: 2-1 to BLUFC.

Good work at the start of the second half between Anya and Chloe to set up Mayca to complete her hatrick.

Forest Green broke away again to score a lucky deflected goal which flew over Ruby's head into the net, but the girls soon hit back through Caitlin who scored two excellent goals, with Forest Green strugging with their goalkeeper having gone off injured after a collision with one of our strikers (mentioning no names, but apparently her head hurt more than your knee in the long run!).

Both our keepers Chloe and Ruby, along with our very good defence (Ellie and Charity and new signing Emily) kept the opponents attackers at bay. Just to finish it off Madison hit one from the edge of the box into the roof of the net.
