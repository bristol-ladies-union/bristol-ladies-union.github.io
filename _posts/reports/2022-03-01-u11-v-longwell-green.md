## Report

Bristol Ladies Union played at home Sunday 27th February to Longwell Green. We were lucky to have a dry sunny day after a week of high winds and rain.

BLUs started off strong. Pippa and Lily were in defence and doing a great job.  Lamorna made a nice pass to Jess who then passed to Evie who nearly scored. Next there was a good tackle from Jess who carried the ball forward and nearly scored….. SO CLOSE !!!! Shortly after Jess then had a run down the line and cut in and scored. The score was 1-0 to us. Following some strong tackling from Lamorna we were unlucky to concede as Longwell Green got an equalising goal. From the restart Longwell Green had a clear-cut chance but a nice save from Maeve kept it out. Iris was trying really hard to press up the pitch and closing down their players. Longwell Green had another shot which glided in. BLU had a few corners and lots of runs from Jess and Evie who came close to scoring.  Longwell Green had a clear run on goal, Maeve nearly saved it but it went in. There was lots of pressing from Iris but Longwell Green scored another goal before half time.

At half time there was lots of encouragement from the BLU coaches. Back on the pitch, Jess had a good attempt for a goal but their goalie made a good save. We then made a substitution and Mairead came on for Lamorna.   Mairead did some tackling and good marking of their players. Alice came in defence and did really well. Evie took a corner and nearly got a goal. Longwell Green had an amazing attempt to score but it was wide. Jess was so close with a shot and only just missed. Maeve made some good saves in the second half but there were no more goals for either team. Good match played by everyone. Well done.
