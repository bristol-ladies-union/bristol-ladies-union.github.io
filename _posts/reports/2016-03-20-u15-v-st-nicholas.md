## Report

Bristol Ladies U15 are still without keeper Chloe, Mayca was out after twisting her knee in training and Emma was away, so the team was down to the bare bones (and Olivia was feeling ill).

Nonetheless, the girls played some really good football and attacked the St Nick's defence from the start. Madison and Anna combined well down the wings, with some strong tackling from Anya to keep breaking up the St Nick's attack: our defenders kept one of the top strikers in the league down to a couple of shots.

Hannah played a good one-two with Anya who then burst through the St Nick's defence to score low into the bottom corner of the net.

1 nil half time score.

The second half began: this half was (literally) all downhill as BLUFC were playing down the slope this half. The girls piled on the pressure and were awarded a penalty... only for Charity to miss!

Within minutes, St Nick's attacked, crossed a ball into our box and some how it managed to end up in our net, levelling the match: game on!

Madison received the ball on the wing, dribbled past a couple of St Nick's defenders and set up Hannah: only for her control to let her down.

Ellie was having a excellent game (not giving any ground) along with her co-defenders Chloe, Charity and Emily, and Sophie and Olivia played well... once they started playing.

The game looked like it was heading for a draw, only for Madison to collect the ball on the edge of the box and hit a shot right over the keeper's head into the roof of the net, taking all three points. Great game.

> Final scoreÂ 2 - 1

> Players of the match: Madison and Anya
