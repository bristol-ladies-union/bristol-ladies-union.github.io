## Report

Everybody turned up well-rested following an unusual Sunday morning lie-in, with todayâ€™s match kicking off at 12:30pm (much appreciated by all parents and coaches). We slowly eased ourselves into the match, starting off a little bit rocky. But our defence was looking strong, with Rosie and Eleanor clearing the ball away from the box with power and accuracy straight to our starting midfielders (Isla, Bonnie and Zoe). If their strikers did manage to get through then we were in safe hands with Abbie in goal, who was confidently throwing herself around the place and catching the ball. Isla was controlling the game well as central midfielder, taking on their players and passing the ball to our wingers (Bonnie and Zoe) who dribbled the ball all the way into the box. Sophie was reading the game well as our striker, getting into the best positions for through-balls from midfield, creating chances for the team but none quite hitting the back of the net. A quick switch around saw Leah (a regular defender) take on midfield, backed up by Evie in defence behind her. Both players were supporting each other well, with Leah tracking back and Evie covering Leah when she went further up the pitch. Further supported by Niamh in defence, covering the whole pitch and picking up players in spaces, when the ball came to those players Niamh was there with her strong clearances, getting it out of the danger zone. We entered half-time still in the game.

A big shoutout to our new watergirl Chloe, who supplied the girls with drinks throughout the whole match and orange slices at half time so the girls were re-energised and ready for the second half.

The second half started and the girls were feeling positive. The game was tight but we were still creating chances. Rosie was on fire, covering the whole of the pitch, tackling their players and winning the ball back every time. Bonnie was strong on the wing, travelling with the ball up the line and crossing it into midfield, where Alice was stood ready to tap it in, we were so close but nobody was quite getting on the scoresheet. Evie was showing off her wonder-throws again, getting our other midfielders into good positions. Following many attempts, our time finally came. Isla won the ball at the half-way line then steamed forwards, running past their midfielders, before placing an amazing through-ball to Sophie who charged through their defence and placed it in the bottom left corner. Everybody was demonstrating confident football, passing the ball around the players without panicking in possession. Despite many more chances, the final whistle was blown.

The girls worked really hard today, covering every blade of grass. Our Star Players went to Rosie (for an outstanding defensive performance and pushing up and supporting our midfielders) and Bonnie (for not stopping running and her strong tackles).
