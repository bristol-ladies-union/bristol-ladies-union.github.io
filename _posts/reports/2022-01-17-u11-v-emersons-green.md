## Report

On Sunday 16th January BLU U11 played at home to Emersons Green. The game started off with an early goal to Emersons Green though after some fierce tackling and defending it wasn’t long till Evie levelled it off with a nice pass from Jess. We soon settled into the game with some good teamwork including strong defending from Pippa and midfield pressure by Betsy. We then had some close shots by Iris and Jess, some brilliant saves by Kate, who really threw herself into it, but another goal closed the first half at 2-1.

We began the second half with a strong start, some powerful long shots on goal by Lamorna and great runs weaving in and out by Kate, though the other team’s defenders proved quite hard to get round. Down at our end we kept the pressure up with confident, strong kicks and clearing by Ellie and Lily. The third goal was scored but we didn’t give up. Katherine made some speedy runs up the wing and helped to get  the ball to Jess who made a close shot. Emersons Green scored again from a rebound from Betsy having made an incredible save.  Overall we played really well as a team, it was a close contest and we have a lot to be proud of.
