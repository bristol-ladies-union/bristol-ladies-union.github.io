The U13s travelled to Holland on a mini tour to take part in a 11v11 tournament in Rotterdam. The standard was unknown so it was exciting to see how the U13s would perform against Dutch teams that were already playing 11-a-side. The girls were fantastic, putting in some great performances on a really hot day! winning 3 and drawing 1 to finish top of the table and tournament winners! We certainly played the best football out of all the teams so the win was well deserved.

We also had the opportunity to play a friendly against Mirre's old team, VOC, who made us feel very welcome. The whole trip was a fantastic experience for the girls, brilliantly organised by Yzten. Hopefully VOC will head over to Bristol next summer for the return leg!
