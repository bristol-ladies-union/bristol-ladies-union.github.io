## Report

BLUs travelled to Emerson Green on a very wet and windy day to play against Longwell Green Tigresses. The weather wasnâ€™t the best but the BLUs were determined to give it their all and all showed determination.

The game started with an early goal to Longwell Green, the BLUs fought back with excellent teamwork from all which led to a very close goal by Jess and Betsy but got saved by the goalie. Kate was up for the challenge in goal and made a smashing save. Ellie showed great confidence getting into space for Betsy to pass. Lily and Iris showed strong tackling in defence to return the ball pass the halfway line and set up for a goal. The weather took a turn for the worse making it difficult to play but the BLUs battled on. Almost needed a snorkel to see the ball! Some excellent footwork by Alice in midfield gave a chance to score. Astrid made a great tackle in defence taking the ball up the field to Jess.

By halftime Longwell Green were ahead, a change of positions in the second half gave some chance for a rest, BLUs showed strong signs of scoring however Longwell Green had other ideas. Alice took up midfield and made an amazing tackle, Betsy passed from the corner towards the goal, Mairead took her chance for a shot but the goalie saved it. Evie was in line to accept the ball and took her shot sadly striking the post. Longwell Green took another shot but Astrid guided the ball towards the corner.

It was a great performance for both teams and BLUs showing so much determination, teamwork throughout. Sadly not taking home the win this time.
