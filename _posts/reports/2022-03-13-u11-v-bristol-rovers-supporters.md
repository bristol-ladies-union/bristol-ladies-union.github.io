## Report

In an unusual afternoon fixture we travelled across Bristol to play Bristol Rovers Supporters Club, who were surprisingly able to find nine supporters!!! A kit clash between our famous blue and the blue and white quarters of the opposition meant that we had to play in red and orange bibs, although it may have been more pleasurable for those watching if the other team had worn the bibs.

Although Bristol Rovers had kick off, some great interceptions and passes from the whole team lead to an early and well taken goal from Jess. In an early period that both team shared possession Maeve made several crucial saves to keep the advantage. Iris seemed to be everywhere tackling every opposition player. Evie joined the play and with her first touch doubled our lead, followed by a second goal from Jess before half-time.

At half time a keeper switch was made where Kate went in goal giving Maeve the opportunity to play out on the pitch.

Some outstanding play, showing all of the skills learnt on our Wednesday training sessions, meant that we had most of the possession. Lamorna linked defence and attack well with good running and skill. Jess scored her third goal of the game from a good team move. Evie added her second of the game before Katherine scored the final goal of the game with a powerful run down the left and a great finish. Ellie nearly scored two goals towards the end of the match with strong, powerful shots just failing to beat their keeper. Further opportunities from Maeve and Mairead nearly added to our lead but it was without success. Strong defending from the whole team, with a special mention to Alice, meant that Kate had very little to do in goal for majority of the second half but what she did have to do she did excellently.

The full time whistle went and meant that we had won with each girl fully playing their part and all were very happy at the end. What better way to celebrate a victory than a play in the park!! Letâ€™s hope that this amazing performance is carried forward to our remaining fixtures this season.
