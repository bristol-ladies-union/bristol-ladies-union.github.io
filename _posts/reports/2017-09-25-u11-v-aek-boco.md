## Report

BLU began their second game of the season with three points in the bag - and they were hungry for more.

Despite numerous efforts on goal from Anna and Freya, BLU went into the break 1-0 down. A dipping strike from Bath’s number twelve looped over Gemma in goal.

An inspired switch saw Gemma start the second half upfront, bagging her first goal of the season within minutes. A smart turn-and-finish following a series of blocks from the Bath defenders.

Gemma’s goal seemed to kick the team into life. Evie-Jean began a bursting run from midfield and composed herself before slotting past the goalkeeper.

Gemma followed up on her first goal of the game to bag a brace with a strike similar to Evie-Jean’s. A change of pace took her past Bath’s defensive line, before she found the net with a calm finish.

BLU managed to see the game out to add another three points to their tally.

POTM: Gemma (bagged a brace to open her account for the season).
