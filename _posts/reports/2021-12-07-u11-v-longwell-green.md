## Report

On Sunday 5 December, the BLU U11 squad travelled to Longwell Green. Under a grey sky, on a freezing day, both coaches and players had to keep moving to stay warm.

As the match kicked off, our forwards, Jess and Evie, pressed vigorously, creating a few early chances. Soon, Evie had put us in front with our first goal. At the other end of the pitch, Kate and Katherine in defence were putting in some stunning tackles against a physical opposition. We were playing confidently and passing accurately – our training the Wednesday before had really paid off.

The opposition’s defence was hard to dribble past, but soon, we’d hit the back of the net twice more, thanks to Jess and Evie. In the dying moments of the first half, Lamorna took our corner and crossed the ball expertly to Jess, who fired it at the keeper. She made a fantastic save, but the rebound fell straight to Betsy, who smashed it in on the half-volley. Lamorna quickly added another just before the half time whistle to make it a perfect first half.

After an inspiring half-time team talk, we were keen to get back into it. Longwell Green came back fighting, though, and had several excellent chances. Luckily, with some super saves from Betsy, we kept them out. Iris created some superb chances in the heart of midfield, while defenders Evie and Maeve did their bit with goal-stopping tackles. Then Jess scored another, but things were looking bad for us when the opposition won a corner. They crossed the ball to the edge of the penalty area, where Katherine deftly blocked the shot. The rebound fell to Longwell Green, but Kate clawed the ball off the line and swiftly scooped it up. We passed the ball up the pitch to Jess, who slotted it home for our final goal, and her hat-trick!

Altogether, we felt like this was our best match of the season so far – thank you, coaches, and also Longwell Green for being amazing opponents!
