## Report

The Dev Team travelled over an hour to Mitcheldean FC, on the edge of the Forest of Dean. The opposition were solid with strong defence; we had several decent chances in the first half, with decent passes being put into space behind their defence, but we lacked the end product and went into half time 0-0. The girls were told at the break that we were no way going to be leaving without a win, having travelled all the way up here. With 20 minutes to go, we shuffled the players around a bit, and that gave us a bit more traction up front. Eventually, Esme got put through and managed to outpace their strong centre back, slotting the winner. A hard-fought win, leaving us at the top of the table.
