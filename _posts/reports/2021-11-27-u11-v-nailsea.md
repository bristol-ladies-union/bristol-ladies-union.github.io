## Report

On Sunday the 21st November the U11 girls played against Nailsea at Canford Park in a very close game with some fantastic goals from Kate, Mairead (it was her first goal for the team) and Iris as well as very good goals from Nailsea. There were  lots of great tackles and clearances from Pippa, Emilie supported by Alice and Iris in defence which means that in the second half we were better at marking therefore it was easier for us to attack. There was some great goalkeeping from Maeve as well as some great midfielding from Lily and Astrid and attacking from Lamorna who created loads of space and lovely passing.  We passed the ball well due to our good communication and our good positioning on the pitch. We had so many attempts at scoring goals but Nailsea had a very good and experienced goalie who saved a lot of our shots. Overall it was a fantastic game which we were unlucky to narrowly lose. We never gave up and always pushed ourselves to catch up on the score. A huge thank you to all the cheering from the subs (who did well to keep warm as it was very cold), spectators and our amazing coaches for encouraging us.
