> BLU  1-0 Whitchurch

BLU continued their 100% start to the season with a home win against Whitchurch.

The first half was end to end. Whitchurch hit the post from an early penalty, with Evie-Jean and Jas both fizzing shots past the post at the other end.

At half time, BLU knew that they had work to do and they began the second half well by applying some early pressure.

They continued to press and finally got their reward.

Anna intercepted a pass in midfield before laying it off to Freya - she slid a pass through to Evie-Jean, who finished emphatically past the goalkeeper.

Following the goal, both sides experienced spells of possession but neither could breach each others' resolute defences.

The game ended 1-0 to Bristol Ladies Union U12s.
