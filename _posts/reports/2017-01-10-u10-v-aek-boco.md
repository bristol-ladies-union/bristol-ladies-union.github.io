> BLU Under 10’s 5-2 AEK BOCO

The Christmas break appears to have had little effect on BLU’s Under 10’s form. They returned to action play a strong Boco side this Sunday.

During the first half BLU played some of their best football of the season. They started strongly with crisp passing from Anna & Amy, sharp shots from Gemma & Freya and solid defending from Macy and Jas. Thanks to some staunch defending by Boco and a fine goalkeeping display by from the Boco keeper BLU could not find the breakthrough and went into the break at 0-0.

Just one minute into the second half BLU broke the deadlock. Anna broke through the midfield and found Grace free in the box, who struck the ball into the bottom left hand corner of the goal. 1-0.

After finding the breakthrough the game opened up intricate triangular passing from Anna & Katie F they found Gemma with the ball down the right wing, she squared it across goal for Jas to slot home. 2-0.

Boco fought back and managed to breach the BLU defence, with a strong right footed finish past Amy 2-1.

BLU were straight back into their rhythm and when Katie L rolled the ball to Gemma she restored the two goal advantage with a right-footed shot into the top corner 3-1.

The pressure was mounting on Boco and the pressure resulted in Freya’s spectacularly long shot somehow managing to sneak under the keeper and roll into the bottom left hand corner of the goal. 4-1.

Boco continued to battle and the BLU defence was broken again and the ball was calmly rolled into the bottom left hand corner of the net. 4-2.

But BLU finished off a free scoring second half with Ella finished off a good team move with a powerful strike. 5-2.

A fantastic end to a fantastic performance and result. BLU player of the match Macy.

Well done also to a battling Boco…Good luck for the rest of the season.
