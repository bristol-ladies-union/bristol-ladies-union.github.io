## Report

After many weeks of not having a game. We have finally managed to organise one. It was great to see the girls up for their first 9 aside game with OFFSIDES! After waiting 40 minutes to get the gates open and a quick warm up from Isla. We lined up with Abbie in goal obviously. We had Leah, Susie and Eleanor in defence. We adopted a new role today for Rosie and that was the central defensive midfield (CDM) position. Zoe and Bonnie providing the width and Isla in the middle of the park. Finally leading the line, one of our star number 9’s Sophie.

The game started well with it being very even against Emerson’s. The girls were trying to get the match intensity back after not playing for several weeks. But they got it back and we were in gear. Abbie as always helping her team out the best way she can - literally saving everything that came her way. At one point tackling with her feet in her own box. Really improving her distribution with the long kicks to Sophie, who showed amazing pressing from the front. Really applying the pressure to the Emerson’s defenders. Leah, Susie and Eleanor provided a really solid foundation for the team, playing out with the ball and most importantly trying their best to stop all of the Emerson’s attackers. Rosie was receiving the ball off the defenders and trying to find the likes of Zoe, Isla and Bonnie, so they can create chances. Zoe showing real strength by staying on the ball and really getting her body in the way, and trying to move the team up the pitch. Darting runs by Bonnie on the other side, leaving Emerson players looking at the number on her shirt. Eleanor like Maldini at the back calm under pressure. Leah providing powerful clearances. Susie anchoring the defence, organising and when she is needed she puts a crunching tackle in. Sophie getting on the end of all the clearances and trying to create chances for all the other attackers, running into space and trying to cross the ball into the box. Isla receiving the ball and fired a shot that hit the underside of the crossbar leaving the Emerson’s goalie standing like a statue. Unfortunately, luck was not on our side. We saw the introduction of Lexie and Evie. Lexie trying out in defence, she did not look out of place, really fighting for the ball and getting stuck in. Evie was the next player to play in our CDM role and I have never seen skill like that in the middle of the park, leaving Emerson Green player stranded. Really getting into the grips with that role. A lovely give and go by Zoe and Evie, saw Zoe running down the wing. After Isla’s amazing effort, she then slotted Sophie in with a lovely weighted pass and Sophie doing exceptionally well to stay onside. No doubt Sophie was going to slot it in the back of the net, bagging us a goal. That was the end of the first half.

Second half, the girls came back on and were ready and pumped to try get something out of the game.  We were creating chances but it was not falling for the girls, which left them frustrated. We had more darting runs from Bonnie and amazing strength pushing people off the ball and winning possession back. We had some amazing tackles and some theatrical diving from the opposition. Isla providing lovely crosses for the team unfortunately no one getting on the end of them. We had Eleanor cameo on wing to provide lots of width, being really positive with her play and trying to push everyone up the pitch. Sophie showing another positive performance encouraging everyone and making darting runs in space and her hold up play, at one point she caught the ball and provided her own display of the hand of god (next time Sophie just near the goal and less obvious please!). Great coverage from all of our midfield and wingers. Loads of running and being strong on the ball. Creating chances and just enjoying playing most importantly. All the players that played in defence today really put a shift in trying to protect Abbie. But unfortunately we found out today Abbie’s hands are not indestructible and she has sustained a sprain to her wrist. Hopefully she has a speedy recovery and we will see another great display at the tournament. If not all the Liverpool supporters in the team will go in goal - (Jamil’s idea).

This season we have had amazing performances from the girls. So much improvement and for their first season playing competitive football and already making the step up to 9aside it can only get better with time. Thanks to all of our support home and away (insert hashtag #BLUARMY). We will hopefully see everyone on Wednesday. Rest up for the tournament, we are looking to win every game!
