## Report

2 days in a row and I am just getting into the flow of writing these reports. Firstly, let me start off by saying what an amazing game and the confidence shown from all the girls. 12pm KO and we were ready after a successful tournament the day before. Furthermore, the girls were looking for revenge from when we last played them. We also played 8-aside which was suggested by the St Nicks coach. The starting line up we saw obviously Abbie Neuer in goal, with Rosie and Susie or the reincarnation of Rio Ferdinand and Vidic. In midfield we had Isla, Bonnie and Zoe and just in front we had Sophie taking on a centre attacking midfielder (CAM) role and finally our other star striker Poppy leading the pack today. On the bench we had Alice, Evie and Eleanor. They were ready to come on and make an impact. Unfortunately, we were also missing our other class defenders in Leah and Niamh. Hopefully we will see them back in action next week!

As expected from the first whistle the girls were pressuring St Nicks and pinning them back. Isla creating chances in abundance as usual. Amazing vision to set up Poppy and Sophie with many through balls to open the St Nicks defence. Rosie showing her strength and determination surrounded by 4 players at one point but still coming away with the ball. Susie once again sweeping and protecting our goal. Many clearances especially one that caught a St Nicks player in the face (definitely did not want to get in the way of that one). Then we saw amazing link up play like prime Cole and Yorke from Poppy and Sophie. With Poppy holding up the ball and playing a pass for Sophie to run on too. Unfortunately, the St Nicks goalie was ready and retrieved the ball. Straight after we saw a pass from Isla to Poppy who shot with the outside of her foot and it just went wide. Zoe then won the ball back from the goal kick and dribbled past the most of the St Nicks player – it was very Messi-esque. But unfortunately the goalie was in the way again. 15 minutes into the game we finally broke the dead lock. A wonderful pass from Poppy to find Isla who slotted it in the bottom corner. Honestly, Isla is on fire I wish I had her on my Fantasy Premier league. We then saw Evie again with her Rory Delap inspired throw. And her determination with tracking back and attacking the St Nicks goal. Many good runs made by Evie and her commitment and stepping into defence for the team. When St Nicks managed to trouble us we didn’t have to worry as Eleanor, Rosie and Susie were tackling and trying to stop everything they could for the team. Especially Eleanor showing her strength and aggression to win the ball back. If anything did manage to get past the defence we saw Abbie catch everything, come out of her box and clearing the ball up the pitch and even emphatic rolling – at least it wasn’t muddy today! We also saw Bonnie cover literally every blade of grass. This girl doesn’t stop, always running and contributing, amazing strength and lightning speed. Finally, we saw Alice coming on in the striker position controlling the ball and running at the St Nicks defenders and causing a havoc. Even getting some shots off and starting off some lovely link up play. This saw the end of the first half and the girls were not slowing down.

Start of the second half we saw Rosie go into the CAM role. Seeing Rosie advance in the final third and creating chances and also doing her defensive duties. Also, Rosie left frustrated still chasing her first goal of the season, great shots but the keeper was matching it. Zoe got 99 dribbling on her. Going past everyone, getting kicked and still not falling down. Great determination. We saw a lovely pass from Bonnie to Isla and it went just wide. Amazing play from our maestros in midfield the whole game. Poppy then showcased her amazing snapshots. Turning and shooting first time. Unlucky as it went just wide. Have to say this game the amount of pressing from all the girls was amazing. Especially, Sophie who was closing down the St Nicks players and nearly getting a lucky deflection which led to her shot on goal. Finally, we bagged our second of the game with a throw from Zoe into space for Isla who took a touch and winded back her wonder of a right foot and it could not have been saved. So many great performances if I keep writing it will end up being a Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Today’s star player was difficult as everyone gave their all and it was such a hard call but our first star player was Abbie for making incredible saves and providing an amazing distribution and outlet for the rest of the team. Our second star player was Poppy for her amazing link up play, creating chances for herself and her other attacking team mates and finally constantly being a threat, another true number 9 performance. Big shout out to the BLU army! The support was unbelievable and louder than Man City’s empty-had ever is. To end the match report I just wanted to say Happy Mother’s Day to all the mum’s. You really deserve it and hope this win made your day even more. See you all soon against Weston at home next week!
