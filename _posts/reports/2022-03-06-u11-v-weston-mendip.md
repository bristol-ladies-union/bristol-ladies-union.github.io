## Report

We took the kick off and did some great passing but Weston Mendip managed to get the ball and score an early goal. There was some good passing from Lamorna and Iris which led to a half chance for Jess! Katherine and Pippa were doing some great interceptions and Ellie, Lamorna and Iris had to do some amazing tackles in midfield. On the break, Kate almost got on to Jessâ€™s pass. Then Weston Mendip got the ball back and scored a long range goal. After that Ellie made an awesome pass to Evie which led to a corner!!!

At half time there was a change of goalie from Maeve to Lamorna.

In the first few minutes of the second half we were putting high pressure on Weston Mendip and there was a shot on goal by Jess but it was saved!! Kate almost got us a first but again well saved. When Weston Mendip were on the break Pippa and Kathrine were doing some outstanding challenges!! Lamorna had been making some great saves but could not stop a goal that went into the corner. Maeve came off the bench to make some big tackles! Despite probably being tired Jess still made runs down the left. A hand ball gave us a late penalty but unfortunately the ball just went over the goal! It was a great effort by everyone, well done!!!!
