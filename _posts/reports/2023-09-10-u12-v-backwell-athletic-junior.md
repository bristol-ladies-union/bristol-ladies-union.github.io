## Report

After a long week of sunshine and our victorious pre-season game. We were ready to build the new goals again and ready for the thunder, lightning and rain! Match reports will be back this season and right now I’m writing this in Bristol Airport, so it can be uploaded for Emma to read before she gets in the bath.

Today we faced a very inexperienced Backwell junior team. It was their very first match ever. This was our first ever competitive league game and our second game at our new home the BAWA! We did not disappoint with this game. There were lots of goals.

We lined up with our new captain Abbie in between the sticks! Safe pair of hands, confident and comfortable the whole game. Our back three we had what people call the Great Wall of China but we know them as Immy, Anna and Lois! In the midfield we didn’t have the overrated midfield of Havertz, Ødegaard and Rice but we had Poppy running the show with Bonnie and Evie off the wing. BLU’s didn’t have to pay £170 million for that midfield! Leading the line we had Zoe and Grace. An energetic front 2 with bags of pace and ruthless finishing. For our impact players we had Rosie, who came on in several positions, always reliable and calm on the ball, and Tianna with her unbelievable pace, strength and true winger instincts to get to the byline and looking for the cross.

I can’t remember all the goals. I’m not going to lie, I wasn’t expecting us to score this many! I will mention the more memorable ones in my opinion.

Clean sheet from our captain. There’s nothing more I expect from Abbie and that’s from the whole coaching team! Grace did start off our scoring for the league this season! Immy with a wonderful run from left back and I’ll say it was a shot but some may say it was a cross! (A ‘crot’ in true Beth Mead style). Nonetheless, great finish and constant grafting, breaking up play and winning the ball back possession. Evie dancing past the defence and ruthlessly finishing leaving the goalie no chance. Bonnie with a goal and assist for Zoe’s goal. Bonnie crossed it in and Zoe waiting for her chance on the penalty spot just like Gary Lineker! Anna getting a chance further forward as she only touched the ball once in the first half. She didn’t disappoint by bagging herself a goal, a pass came across the box, Anna controlled and with confidence finished it like a professional. If we carry on like this golden boot will be interesting this season, with Grace and Tianna leading the race so far!

It was a good start! But we have to stay grounded, we enjoyed this game but we will have harder games coming. Especially next week with the cup game! Star player this week went to Lois, she had a great game, playing in many positions and slotting in without a hiccup. Amazing passing, switching play, had plenty of shots and bagged 2! Great start to star player, anyone could’ve got it everyone played fantastically. On to next week and good luck to everyone in the squad, let’s get into the next round!
