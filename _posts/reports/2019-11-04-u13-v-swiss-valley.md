## Swiss Valley 0-5 BLU U13s

BLU returned to action with an emphatic victory away at Swiss Valley.

Swiss Valley began the game well and managed to create a couple of chances, neither of which troubled Ella in goal.

Once BLU had eased into the game, they quickly forced saves from the Swiss Valley goalkeeper - Evie-Jean and Jas both saw shots stopped.

Jas opened the storing shortly before half time; tapping in a ricocheted shot that fell to her from Jess’ looping corner. 1-0.

BLU continued to push and doubled their advantage before the break. This time Tia found the bottom corner with her right-footed curler. 2-0.

The away side were much brighter in the second half and quickly rattled the woodwork from Jas’ arrowed hit.

Evie-Jean increased their lead with a perfect shot from the edge of the box. 3-0.

Anna and Freya continued to defend stoically against the Swiss Valley centre-forward, enabling more players to attack.

Tia and Mace stretched the lead to 5-0 at the end of the game. Tia controlled and finished a cross from Anna on the right for 4, and Mace completed a team move with a tap-in on the goal line for 5-0.

The game ended 5-0 to BLU U13s
