## Report

BLU went to Portishead to play an away game, it was perfect weather for a match, sunny and not super cold.

When the game started there was great pressing from Lamorna on the right, leading to an early shot which was well saved. Great work from Kate led to Jess shooting narrowly wide. BLU started as the better team, and there was pressure all over the pitch, not to mention all the corners BLU had. However, the goal didn’t come as quickly as hoped, but BLU got there in the end!  A lot was going down the right with Katherine and Lamorna linking, leading to more corners. Kate had a good shot deflected for another corner. Play switched over the left with Jess getting the ball and running at Portishead, who also defended well. Lamorna had a shot to the right, it’s coming we said to ourselves! Jess played a great diagonal ball to Kate, then Kate also came close with a drag back and shot – close again! Betsy did some great passes, which kept us moving forward.  Jess then had a fantastic solo run and shot, which the keeper saved well. Ellie looked positive (not for Covid!) at the back, working well with Katherine to stop the pressing Portishead.  Still 0-0.

Pressure then built from Portishead, who scored from their first corner of the game; a strong shot into the left of the goal. It was against the run of play but well taken.  We all got a bit nervous then but then equalised, straight in from Jess at the corner!  Then suddenly we scored again! Betsy’s shot was stopped by a defender, but sneaks in!  Just before the half time whistle, Portishead break and shoot a strong low shot, which Maeve gathers with confidence.  

Second half starts as the first ended, with a corner to BLU. Suddenly Betsy did a throw in over the defence, which Jess then volleyed into the net. The fans loved it! Alice was looking lively while keeping up the pressure on the left. Portishead were still trying to win, which was great to see, so we had to keep defending and push to our hardest.  Lily at left back was never going to let the attackers past, and kept defending brilliantly.

In one of the most exciting moments, the Portishead keeper made a triple save with Mairead coming closest to scoring. Lamorna then finds herself clear twice to shoot from distance, the first well saved and the second fizzed to the left. Because we didn’t give up, this led to a final BLU goal, which was scored by Mairead. It was a precise diagonal ball from Betsy through the defence for Mairead to nicely finish. With the game almost over, Portishead then pulled one back with a great passing move leading to a last goal of the match.

It was a great performance for both teams, but we were pleased to take home the win.
