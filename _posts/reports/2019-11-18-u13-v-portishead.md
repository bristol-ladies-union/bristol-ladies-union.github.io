## Report

Evie-Jean found the breakthrough 10 minutes after her effort from outside the box went high and wide. She controlled Anna’s looping cross and fired into the net to make it 1-0 to BLU.

BLU then withstood a period of Portishead pressure, with Ella forced into a save with her feet.

Evie-Jean doubled the blues’ advantage minutes later with a clever run and low finish under the goalkeeper to make it 2-0 to BLU.

She then completed her hattrick immediately afterwards with another intelligent run that was not picked up by the Portishead defence. Evie-Jean’s chipped effort was blocked on the line and she smashed the rebound into the net for 3-0 on the stroke of half time.

BLU increased the pressure in the second half and Evie-Jean netted quickly after the restart. This time Anna’s perfectly weighted pass matched Evie-Jean’s run and she poked the ball home for 4-0.

As BLU looked for more goals, they were susceptible to Portishead’s agile counter-attacks, but Appoline and Amy were able to recover possession for BLU on several occasions.

Evie-Jean scored her fifth of the game late on. Neat footwork and clever movement from Jess opened up space for her to lay a pass off to Evie-Jean on the edge of the box - who curled an effort into the bottom right corner for 5-0.

BLU managed the rest of the game well and it ended 5-0 to Bristol Ladies Union.
