## Report

Our Sunday match started as any other at Canford Park. As the ref blew his whistle, the match started very quickly. Our team applied lots of pressure and harrying from Emilie and Katherine who were forcing lots of mistakes from the other team. We were defending really well with Pippa clearing the ball and we were determined to win. However they scored their first goal from the first bit of pressure they had. Kate then popped up to score a really nice goal from the left. The next shot that we had almost went in and Lamorna was scoring it. It hit the post just as it was about to go in. Ellie did some great pressuring and Maeve bravely blocked a defender from scoring. Lily came on and did lots of running in the middle.

It is now half time. We had a quick pep talk and then we started playing again.

Maeve saved a wonderful shot from Narla; their stand out player. Narla scored the next goal from a corner and the next goal after that. As we were about half way through the second half, Maeve got injured by being whacked in the face by the opposing team so Kate went in goal and she nearly saved a goal that went in the left hand corner of the goal but it went in. The next exciting thing that happened was that Western Mendip got a penalty. Kate got a hand to touch the ball but it still went in the net. Next, Mairead almost scored. At the last possible moment the goalie saved it. Kate did a nice save and Alice was doing some good tackling. Evie had a chance at scoring but just missed. Evie also managed a really good corner. The last thing that happened was that Kate almost saved a really strong shot but it slipped through her fingers and that was the end of the match.
