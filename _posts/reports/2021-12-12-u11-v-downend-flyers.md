## Report

On Sunday the 12th of December, BLU U11 played home at Canford Park against Downend Flyers. There was a welcome change in temperature compared with the freezing conditions last week.

BLU got off to a good start with Jess having a skilful run and forcing a great save from the Flyer’s keeper. BLU piled on the pressure, resulting in a number of goal mouth scrambles with Evie and Pippa in the thick of the action and somehow, the Flyers kept the ball out of the net. The pressure eventually payed off with Kate breaking the deadlock and her goal celebration was almost as good as the goal itself. Kate rapidly added a second goal following intricate build up play involving most of the team. She then wrapped up her hattrick following an outstanding individual effort.

The Flyers pulled a goal back following a powerful shot from their centre forward and another following a defensive mix up. Their centre forward added to her tally as the BLU defence was unlocked by a long through ball with Maeve unable to save us again.

At the end of the first half, BLU were under the cosh. It required, skilful teamwork and real effort to prevent the Flyers going in with a half time lead.

Andy’s inspiring team talk had an immediate effect on our players. BLU started the second half as brightly as the first. Another powerful run by Jess resulted in a cross that Kate just failed to connect. Kate swiftly added a 4th goal with a good individual dribble and shot.

The Flyers were not out of it and forced good saves from Besty and a well-timed block from Lamorna when the Flyers looked certain to score.

BLU added another after a good move down our right wing and cross for Jess to tap in. Knee slider celebrations all round!

The Flyers finished the second half like the first, testing the BLU defence requiring excellent interventions from Emily, Pippa and Katherine. Despite our efforts we couldn’t close the game down and conceded two further goals in the dying minutes, meaning that the match ended in a thrilling draw.
