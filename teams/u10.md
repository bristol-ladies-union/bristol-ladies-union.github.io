Our Under 10 girls team represent Bristol Ladies Union FC in the Bristol Girls League on Sunday mornings. The girls play 7-a-side games on grass that typically kick off at 10:30AM. Home games are at [BAWA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9rU15URNdAquGL73A), and away games are across Bristol and Bath.

The girls train throughout the year on Wednesday nights on a 3G pitch at Bristol Manor Farm Football Club (on the Portway) between 18:00 and 19:00.

The U10s have one female and two male coaches who are all FA qualified and fully DBS checked, and you can be assured that your children will be in a safe and secure environment to enjoy their football.

There is a well established network of teams across Bristol and we often arrange friendly matches against other local U10 sides outside of the normal league and cup structure. We also enter a number of tournaments through the summer months.

Our main emphasis is simply to have fun playing football and to learn good technique, skills and teamwork.
